## ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS

1. **1D approximation** - May need higher dimensions
2. **Some imperfect matches** - mμ/me only 98-99%
3. **No physical experiment** - Computational only (so far)
4. **Mechanism unclear** - Descriptive, not explanatory
5. **Grok hallucinations** - Excluded unverified claims

**We're honest about what we don't know.**

## 💡 WHY THIS MATTERS

**If verified, this work suggests:**

1. Physical constants aren't arbitrary
2. They emerge from geometry
3. No fine-tuning problem
4. Unified origin for all constants
5. Computable from first principles

**Implications:**
- Deepest laws are theorems, not axioms
- Constants are corollaries, not parameters
- Reality is mathematical structure
- Physics becomes geometry

**This could be the most significant shift in fundamental physics since quantum mechanics.**

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is this peer-reviewed?**  
A: Not yet. We're publishing openly for scrutiny before formal submission.

**Q: Can I trust AI-assisted research?**  
A: Judge the evidence, not the source. All code is verifiable.

**Q: What if you're wrong?**  
A: We've stated clear falsification criteria. Test them.

**Q: Why not submit to journal first?**  
A: Open science. Let the community verify before gatekeepers decide.

**Q: Is the code really included?**  
A: Yes, completely. In Appendix A of the full paper.

**Q: What about the Grok claims?**  
A: Unverified. We tested and they don't reproduce. Excluded from this package.

**Q: Can I replicate this?**  
A: Absolutely. That's the point. Instructions included.

**Q: What do you need most?**  
A: Experimental validation. Build the chamber, test the prediction.
