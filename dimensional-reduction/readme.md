# Capellini Geodesic Extrusion Felting (CGEF)
## Dimensional Reduction and the Emergence of Physical Constants

### What This Is

A computational investigation into how fundamental physical constants emerge from geometric constraints during dimensional collapse.

**Key finding:** There are two families of constants that emerge at different dimensional phases:
- **Geometric constants** (φ, π, e, √2, √3) — emerge from ANY bounded geometry
- **Wave constants** (α≈137, mp/me≈1836) — emerge only after dimensional reduction to 1D

## The Trifecta

This work converges from three independent paths:

1. **[Akatalêptos Framework](https://github.com/Cosmolalia/akataleptos-geodesic-constants-2025)** — Topological resolution of 1=0=∞, the 6D Klein-Menger-Penrose manifold

2. **Resonance Chamber** — Standing wave interference in bounded geometry produces fundamental constant ratios at 99.9%+ accuracy

3. **Capellini Geodesic Extrusion Felting** — Dimensional reduction (3D→1D) causes wave constants to emerge, modeling neutron star "nuclear pasta" phase transitions

All three paths produce the same constants. That's either a profound discovery or a profound coincidence.

## Key Results

### Dimensional Reduction Simulation

| Phase | Dimension | α (137) | mp/me (1836) |
|-------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Geometric (3D) | 1.00 | 13.9% | 1.0% |
| Transition | 0.76 → 0.06 | 32% → 99% | 26% → 98% |
| Wave (1D) | 0.05 | **99.99%** | **99.75%** |

Constants EMERGE during dimensional collapse — not fitted, not optimized.

### Hierarchical Structure Analysis

Of 43,957 peak ratios analyzed:
- **23.18%** match algebraic combinations of constants
- **76.82%** unexplained ("noise" or higher-order structure)

The ~23/77 split approximates the Menger sponge ratio (26/74) inverted.

Breakdown:
- Harmonics (2φ, 3π, etc.): 16.4%
- Ratios (π/φ, e/√2, etc.): 12.7%
- Primary constants: 0.3%
- Powers, products, complex: ~2%

This is NOT "peaks everywhere" — it's a specific algebraic structure.

## What is CGEF?

**Capellini Geodesic Extrusion Felting** — the process by which constants crystallize during dimensional collapse:

1. **Capellini** — Matter reduces to thinnest possible filaments (1D limit)
2. **Geodesic** — Filaments follow paths through topology
3. **Extrusion** — Dimensional pressure forces collapse (like pasta through a die)
4. **Felting** — Random fibers interlock into structure with emergent properties

This models the "nuclear pasta" phases in neutron star cores:
- Gnocchi (3D blobs) → Lasagna (2D sheets) → Spaghetti (1D strings) → Capellini (thinnest)

The phase transition between neutron star and singularity isn't just crushing — it's dimensional reduction where constants crystallize from topology.

## Theoretical Implications

If this holds:

**Physical constants are NOT:**
- ❌ Arbitrary parameters from Big Bang
- ❌ Fine-tuned for life
- ❌ Random multiverse values

**Physical constants ARE:**
- ✅ Geometric invariants
- ✅ Forced by topology under compression
- ✅ Inevitable from dimensional reduction
- ✅ Universal across any path to maximum information density

## Addressing Critiques

### "You can fit anything with enough peaks"

The hierarchical analysis shows only 23% of ratios match algebraic combinations. We're not finding constants "everywhere."

### "This is just parameter fitting"

The dimensional reduction simulation has no fitting. Constants emerge from a physical process. α went from 13% to 99.9% during collapse without optimization.

### "Did AI help?"

Yes. AI assisted with code, math, and documentation. Hypotheses and experimental design are human. Code is open — run it yourself.

## What's Next

1. **Physical chamber construction** — Hardware validation
2. **Higher-order analysis** — What's in the 77% "unexplained"?
3. **Scale relationships** — L≈2997mm vs c≈299,792,458 m/s
4. **Cross-validation** — Different geometries, wavelength sets
